# 🗂️ Temp Code Repository

Welcome to the **Temp Code Repository** — a simple, no-frills storage space for raw code snippets, experiments, and temporary files.

This repository is meant to serve as a sandbox for quick ideas, unpolished drafts, and code that doesn't (yet) belong in a full-fledged project. Think of it as a digital notebook for developers.

## 📁 What's Inside?

Here, you'll find:

- 🧪 Code experiments
- 📝 Temporary or draft scripts
- 📤 Snippets waiting to be refactored or relocated
- 🛠️ Prototypes and test files

These files may not follow a consistent structure, style, or language — they’re stored here for convenience, not production.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains raw and unreviewed code. Use at your own risk. Some files may be incomplete, outdated, or potentially non-functional.

If you decide to use any of these snippets, make sure to thoroughly review and adapt them to your needs.

## ✅ Tips for Contributors (or Future Me)

If you're adding new files:

- Use clear, descriptive filenames.
- Add a short comment at the top of the file to describe its purpose.
- Organize by language or purpose if the repo grows too large.

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

Sometimes you just need a place to drop code without worrying about structure or polish. This is that place.

Use it to capture inspiration, save a solution before you forget it, or test out that weird idea at 2AM.

Happy coding! 🚀
